**1-3 Infinite Skills**  
Three programs I would like to create:  

Automatic document organizer. My different projects are spread out and organized in non standardized ways. Would be nice to have some kind of assistant that organizes stuff and reminds me when I do not follow the standard way to organize my work.  

Robot assistant, a mobile robot that follows me around. Shall take notes to help me remember stuff. Shall also be able to carry stuff. And watch out for eventual dangers such as speeding cars.  

Infographics tool. Program that help out to make good infographics. Should ideally both collect and present the information.
